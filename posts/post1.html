      <p>
        After spending months talking with educators about their daily workflows, I've learned that most AI tools for teachers are solving the wrong problem. They're focused on generating lesson plans, creating assessments, or automating administrative tasks. But what teachers really need isn't more content—it's better insight into what's actually happening in their classrooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reality is that teachers are drowning in data. They have gradebooks, attendance records, assignment submissions, and behavioral notes scattered across multiple systems. When they want to understand how a student is performing, they're forced to manually piece together information from different sources, often during their limited planning periods or after hours.
      </p>

      <h2>The dashboard problem</h2>

      <p>
        Most educational technology tries to solve this with dashboards. But dashboards have a fundamental flaw: they require teachers to remember to check them and know how to interpret the information they display. In a busy classroom environment, this cognitive overhead is often too much to bear.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "I have 150 students across 6 classes. I can't remember to check a dashboard for each one of them. I need the important stuff to come to me, not the other way around."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This feedback from a high school English teacher perfectly captures the issue. Dashboards assume teachers have the time and mental bandwidth to proactively monitor student progress. But teaching is reactive by nature—problems surface when they surface, and teachers need to address them quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>Synthetic insight over synthetic content</h2>

      <p>
        What teachers actually need is synthetic insight, not synthetic content. Instead of generating new materials, AI should synthesize existing information to surface patterns, anomalies, and opportunities that would otherwise go unnoticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, rather than creating a new quiz, AI could analyze a student's recent assignments and flag that their writing quality has declined in the past two weeks, suggesting they might be struggling with a particular concept or dealing with personal issues outside of school.
      </p>

      <h2>Making classrooms saner</h2>

      <p>
        The goal isn't to replace teacher judgment—it's to augment it. Good product design in education means creating tools that make teachers feel more capable, not more overwhelmed. This means:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Surfacing insights proactively rather than requiring active monitoring</li>
        <li>Providing context alongside recommendations</li>
        <li>Respecting teachers' expertise while highlighting patterns they might have missed</li>
        <li>Integrating seamlessly into existing workflows rather than creating new ones</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When we built Gist, we focused on this philosophy. Instead of asking teachers to learn a new interface or remember to check another dashboard, we send them concise, actionable insights about their students' progress. The AI doesn't replace their professional judgment—it just helps them see patterns they might have missed in the noise of daily classroom management.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result? Teachers report feeling more connected to their students' learning journeys and more confident in their ability to intervene when needed. That's the kind of impact we should be aiming for with AI in education.
