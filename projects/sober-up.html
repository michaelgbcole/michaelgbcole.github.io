      <p>
        I'm building an app to help people quit drinking. Although it is for a good cause, I also want to gain experience with stuff like marketing and design. This project will be far less complicated than <a href="https://gist-quiz.com">Gist</a>, but I believe it will be much more successful.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>

      <p>
        Too many wellness apps feel clinical and intimidating. They're designed like medical tools rather than supportive companions. SoberUp aims to be different—it's designed to feel calm rather than clinical, supportive rather than strict.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is to help people build healthier rituals without the judgment and complexity that often comes with traditional recovery apps. Sometimes the simplest approach is the most effective.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "A lightweight accountability app for people building healthier rituals, designed to feel calm rather than clinical."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        More details coming soon as I continue building and learning from this project.
